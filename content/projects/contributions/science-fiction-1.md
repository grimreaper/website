Fully improvised Science Fiction Play.

Beneath a sky of stars and sensors, a night of science fiction and discovery awaits - where everything happens aboard a starship hurtling through the unknown. Guided by your suggestions, the performers will embark on an epic tale of ordinary crew members facing extraordinary challenges in deep space.

On this night, two different stories will unfold, performed by two different groups of improvisers. Each will tell a unique adventure set aboard a starship—where alien encounters, strange anomalies, and moral dilemmas collide with the infinite possibilities of the cosmos.

The story is created on the spot, with the ship, its crew, and its missions brought to life through nothing but imagination. From engineering failures to first contact, every twist is discovered in the moment. Join us for a journey to the stars—no map, no script, just the thrill of the unknown.
