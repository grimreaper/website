Directed by Patricia Miller.

Arthur Miller's classic parable of mass hysteria draws a chilling parallel between the Salem witch-hunt of 1692 - 'one of the strangest and most awful chapters in human history'; - and the American anti-communist purges led by Senator McCarthy in the 1950s. The story of how the small community of Salem is stirred into madness by superstition, paranoia and malice, culminating in a violent climax, is a savage attack on the evils of mindless persecution and the terrifying power of false accusations.  A depiction of innocent men and women destroyed by malicious rumor, The Crucible is also a powerful indictment of McCarthyism and the 'frontier mentality' of Cold War America or now. These themes still resonate today and need to be told by this passionate young and diverse performing company from CCSF Theatre Arts.
