Under a twilight sky of forgotten legends, a night of fantasy and magic awaits where the very fabric of destiny is woven on stage. Guided by your suggestions, the performers will breathe life into an epic tale of an ordinary person thrust into a position of extraordinary circumstances.

They will tell a story set in a world of knights and wizards, of monsters and dragons, and of heroes and villains. They will create the story on the spot, bringing mythical creatures, enchanted forests, and legendary heroes to life. Stunning set pieces and special effects are conjured up with nothing but their imaginations. You will be transported to another world, leaving you breathless with wonder and excitement.

Directed by Rez Graham.
